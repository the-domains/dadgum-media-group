Blanco has seen it all (and done it all) in the world of multimedia television and visual arts. His intense passion for communicating powerful messages from the lens for over 30 years has brought him where he is today producing riveting stories to capture hearts through reality television. Blanco lives with his beloved wife in Fort Pierce -- the treasure coast of Florida. When Blanco is not working in television, he enjoys developing websites, maintaining his e-commerce business, teaching teens how to produce videos as an outreach, and spending time with his family
